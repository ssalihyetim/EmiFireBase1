## 8. CLEANUP RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1: Safe Deletions (Immediate)
1. **Delete all deprecated app routes** (14 files)
2. **Delete temporary files** (2 files)
3. **Delete legacy seed scripts** (4 files)

### Phase 2: Test Script Cleanup (After Verification)
1. **Archive or delete one-time setup scripts** (6 files)
2. **Delete cleanup scripts after use** (6 files)
3. **Move test file to proper location** (1 file)

### Phase 3: Code Optimization (Future)
1. **Review specialized libraries** for actual usage
2. **Consolidate similar functions** across libraries
3. **Optimize large files** like unified-task-automation.ts

## 9. ESTIMATED CLEANUP IMPACT

### File Count Reduction
- **Immediate deletion candidates**: 20 files (~400KB)
- **Review for deletion**: 13 files (~200KB)
- **Total potential cleanup**: 33 files (~600KB)

### Benefits
- Reduced bundle size
- Cleaner codebase structure
- Easier navigation and maintenance
- Reduced confusion from deprecated routes

## 10. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Step 1: Immediate Cleanup
```bash
# Delete deprecated app routes
rm -rf src/app/[non-locale-pages]

# Delete temporary files
rm temp_check.json temp_archives.json

# Delete legacy scripts
rm scripts/seed-machines.js scripts/seed-machines-basic.js scripts/seed-machines-simple.js scripts/test-automation.js
```

### Step 2: Verification
1. Run tests to ensure no broken imports
2. Test all locale-specific routes
3. Verify no 404 errors in navigation

### Step 3: Final Cleanup
1. Remove unused imports after file deletions
2. Update any hardcoded references to deleted files
3. Run production build to verify integrity

## CONCLUSION

The codebase is well-structured overall, with most components and libraries being actively used. The primary cleanup opportunity is removing deprecated locale-based routing files and temporary scripts. This cleanup will significantly improve codebase clarity without affecting functionality.
