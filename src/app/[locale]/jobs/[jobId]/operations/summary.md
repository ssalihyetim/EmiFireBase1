# Operations Management System

## 🎯 **What This Solves**

The **Operations Management Interface** bridges the gap between basic job management and sophisticated auto-scheduling. It provides the missing workflow layer that shows:

1. **How to add specific operations** (Turning, Milling, 5-Axis)
2. **What operations to do next** based on current job state
3. **Real-time scheduling integration** with our enhanced algorithms

## 🔧 **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Operation Templates**
- **Turning**: 30min setup, 5min cycle, turning capabilities
- **3-Axis Milling**: 45min setup, 15min cycle, 3-axis capabilities  
- **4-Axis Milling**: 60min setup, 20min cycle, 4-axis capabilities
- **5-Axis Milling**: 90min setup, 30min cycle, complex geometry
- **Grinding**: 25min setup, 8min precision work
- **Deburring**: 15min setup, 3min finishing

### **2. Smart Operation Addition**
```typescript
// Add any operation type with custom parameters
- Operation Type: Dropdown with all available operations
- Setup Time: Customizable (pre-filled from templates)
- Cycle Time: Customizable (pre-filled from templates)  
- Priority: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- Description: Custom operation description
- Notes: Additional manufacturing notes
```

### **3. Next Operations Intelligence**
The system analyzes current job state and suggests:
- **Material Preparation** → Start workflow
- **3-Axis Milling** → After turning complete
- **5-Axis Milling** → For complex geometry after basic milling
- **Dependencies tracking** → Shows what must be done first

### **4. Real-Time Scheduling Integration**
- **"Schedule All" button** → Calls enhanced auto-scheduler API
- **Machine assignment** → Shows which specific machine  
- **Time slots** → Actual start/end times
- **Progress tracking** → Visual progress bars

### **5. Three-Tab Interface**

#### **Current Operations Tab**
- Table showing all operations for the job
- Status tracking (Pending → Scheduled → In Progress → Completed)
- Machine assignments and progress bars
- Setup/cycle times and priorities

#### **Next Operations Tab**  
- AI-powered suggestions for next steps
- Dependency analysis (what must be done first)
- Priority-based recommendations
- One-click addition of suggested operations

#### **Schedule View Tab**
- Timeline view of scheduled operations
- Machine assignments and time slots
- Duration calculations
- Link to full scheduling interface

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Operations**
```
Jobs Page → Click "Operations" button for any job → Operations Management
```

### **Step 2: Add Operations**
```
1. Click "Add Operation"
2. Select operation type (Turning, 3-Axis Milling, 5-Axis Milling, etc.)
3. Customize setup/cycle times if needed
4. Set priority and add notes
5. Click "Add Operation"
```

### **Step 3: Schedule Operations**
```
1. Click "Schedule All" 
2. System calls enhanced auto-scheduler API
3. Operations get assigned to specific machines
4. Schedule times calculated based on:
   - Machine availability
   - Working hours (8am-5pm)
   - Dependencies between operations
   - Priority levels
```

### **Step 4: Track Progress**
```
- View scheduled times in Schedule tab
- Monitor progress in Current Operations
- See next step recommendations in Next Operations
```

## 📊 **Real-World Example**

### **Aerospace Part Manufacturing**
```
Job: Landing Gear Bracket (Aluminum 7075-T6, Qty: 5)

Current Operations:
1. Turning 1          [Pending]    → Setup: 30m, Cycle: 5m
2. 3-Axis Milling 1   [Pending]    → Setup: 45m, Cycle: 15m  

Next Operations Suggestions:
→ "5-Axis Milling" (Medium Priority)
  Reason: Complex geometry machining after basic operations
  Dependencies: [Turning, 3-Axis Milling]

After Scheduling:
1. Turning 1          [Scheduled]  → NEX110-001, 8:00-8:55 AM
2. 3-Axis Milling 1   [Scheduled]  → AWEA-VM6, 9:15-11:30 AM
3. 5-Axis Milling 1   [Scheduled]  → Fanuc Robodrill, 1:00-3:30 PM
```

## 🔗 **Integration Points**

### **With Existing Systems**
- **Job Management** → Operations button on each job row
- **Enhanced Scheduling** → Direct API integration
- **Task Management** → Links to task execution interface
- **Machine Database** → 21 CNC machines with capabilities

### **With Scheduling Algorithms**
- **Priority Calculator** → Weighted scoring (due date, customer priority, dependencies)
- **Machine Matcher** → 4-factor optimization (capability, load balance, setup, efficiency)
- **Dependency Resolver** → Critical path analysis and topological sorting
- **Auto-Scheduler** → 6-phase processing pipeline

## 📈 **Business Value**

### **Before Operations Management**
❌ Users couldn't see how to add specific operations  
❌ No guidance on what to do next in manufacturing workflow  
❌ Scheduling was disconnected from job management  
❌ No visibility into operation status and progress  

### **After Operations Management**  
✅ **Clear workflow** → Add operations with guided interface  
✅ **Smart suggestions** → AI-powered next step recommendations  
✅ **Integrated scheduling** → One-click scheduling with machine assignment  
✅ **Full visibility** → Real-time status tracking and progress monitoring  
✅ **Production ready** → Complete manufacturing workflow management  

## 🎯 **Impact on Manufacturing Workflow**

This completes the **Phase 3 UI Integration** and provides the missing operational layer between:
- **Strategic Planning** (Offers & Orders) 
- **Tactical Execution** (Tasks & Quality)
- **Operational Scheduling** (Machine Assignment & Timing)

Users now have a **complete end-to-end manufacturing workflow** from order creation to shop floor execution.
