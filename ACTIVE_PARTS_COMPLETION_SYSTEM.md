# Active Parts Completion System

## Overview

The Active Parts system tracks manufacturing parts and automatically removes them from the "active" list when all associated work is completed. This document explains how parts transition out of active status and the implementation details.

## How Parts Go "Out of Active" Status

### ðŸŽ¯ **Implemented Solution: Task-Based Completion (Recommended)**

Parts automatically go out of active status when **ALL associated tasks are completed** in the Jobs â†’ Tasks page. This includes:

1. **Manufacturing Tasks**: All production operations (Turning, Milling, etc.)
2. **Quality Tasks**: Inspection, testing, documentation
3. **Support Tasks**: Packaging, shipping preparation, etc.

#### Why This Approach?

âœ… **Natural Workflow**: Users already go to Jobs â†’ Tasks to check off work  
âœ… **Comprehensive**: Ensures ALL work is done, not just manufacturing  
âœ… **No Extra UI**: Uses existing task completion system  
âœ… **Manufacturing Logic**: A part isn't "complete" until everything is done  

### Alternative Options (Not Implemented)

#### Option 1: Shipping-Based Completion
- Parts go inactive when marked as "shipped" or "delivered"
- Would require additional shipping status tracking
- Good for customer-facing workflows

#### Option 2: Manual Button in Calendar
- Add "Mark Complete" button in calendar interface
- Gives direct user control
- Risk of inconsistencies and forgotten parts

## Technical Implementation

### Core Logic

```typescript
// Check if ALL tasks for a job are completed
const allTasksCompleted = jobTasks.every((task: any) => {
  // Check main task completion
  if (task.status !== 'completed') return false;
  
  // Check ALL subtasks completion (if any)
  if (task.subtasks && task.subtasks.length > 0) {
    return task.subtasks.every((subtask: any) => subtask.status === 'completed');
  }
  
  return true;
});
```

### Database Collections Used

1. **`jobs`** - Main job records
2. **`jobTasks`** - All tasks associated with jobs
3. **`calendarEvents`** - Manufacturing schedule events

### Active Parts Display Features

- **Real-time filtering**: Completed parts automatically hidden
- **Toggle visibility**: Show/hide completed parts with counter
- **Comprehensive overview**: Part name, operations, durations, machines
- **Status tracking**: Visual badges for operation status
- **Completion indicators**: Green styling for completed parts

## User Workflow

### To Complete a Part:

1. Navigate to **Jobs â†’ [Job ID] â†’ Tasks**
2. Check off all main tasks as completed âœ…
3. Check off all subtasks within each task âœ…
4. Part automatically disappears from Active Parts list
5. Can still view by clicking "Show Completed" toggle

### Visual Indicators:

- **Active Parts**: Normal white cards with operation details
- **Completed Parts**: Green-tinted cards with "Completed" badge
- **Counter Badge**: Shows number of hidden completed parts
- **Status Badges**: "Done", "Active", "Scheduled", "Pending" for operations

## Benefits

### For Production Managers:
- Clear visibility of what's actually in production
- No manual tracking of completion status
- Automatic cleanup of finished work

### For Operators:
- Familiar task checkbox workflow
- Clear progression tracking
- No additional steps required

### For Quality Teams:
- Ensures quality tasks are completed before removal
- Comprehensive completion tracking
- Audit trail through task history

## Configuration

### Toggle Completed Parts:
```typescript
const [showCompletedParts, setShowCompletedParts] = useState(false);
```

### Refresh Active Parts:
- Automatically refreshes when calendar data changes
- Manual refresh button available
- Updates on task completion events

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Jobs without tasks**: Remain active until tasks are created and completed
2. **Partial task completion**: Parts remain active until ALL tasks done
3. **Mixed status**: Operations can be at different stages
4. **Data synchronization**: Active parts update when calendar events change

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
- **Shipping integration**: Optional shipping-based completion
- **Custom completion rules**: Configurable completion criteria
- **Notifications**: Alert when parts complete
- **Analytics**: Completion time tracking and reporting
- **Export functionality**: Export completed parts data

### Integration Points:
- **ERP systems**: Sync completion status
- **Customer portals**: Notify completion
- **Inventory systems**: Update stock levels
- **Quality systems**: Archive quality records

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Console Logging:
```
ðŸ“‹ Found X completed jobs that were filtered out from active parts
```

### Refresh Frequency:
- Active parts reload on calendar data changes
- Manual refresh button available
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds with calendar sync

### Performance:
- Efficient database queries with filtered results
- Minimal overhead on existing workflow
- Cached completion status calculations
