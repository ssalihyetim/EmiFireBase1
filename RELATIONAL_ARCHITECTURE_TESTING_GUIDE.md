# Relational Architecture Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the **Relational Architecture Foundation (Phase 1)** implementation in your manufacturing platform. The implementation includes comprehensive type systems, relationship management, traceability chains, and AS9100D compliance frameworks.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

**COMPLETED FEATURES:**
- ‚úÖ Complete type system (`src/types/relational.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Relationship management library (`src/lib/relational-architecture.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Quality tracking integration (`src/lib/quality-aware-task-completion.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Manufacturing forms system (`src/lib/manufacturing-forms.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Archive integration with relational context
- ‚úÖ Pattern creation with relational insights
- ‚úÖ AS9100D compliance framework

## üß™ Testing Methods

### 1. Automated Implementation Test

**What it tests:** Core type definitions, class structures, and basic functionality.

```bash
# Run the implementation test
npx tsx scripts/test-relational-implementation.ts
```

**Expected Result:** All 6 tests should pass (100% success rate).

### 2. Manual UI Testing

#### A. Jobs with Relational Context

1. **Navigate to Jobs Page** (`/jobs`)
2. **Create a New Job:**
   - Click "Create Job" or convert from an order
   - Fill in job details (part name, quantity, etc.)
   - Notice that jobs now include relational context fields:
     - `customerId`: Links to customer data
     - `orderId`: Links to source order
     - `contractId`: Links to contract requirements

3. **Verify Relational Data:**
   - Jobs should display customer names (resolved from `customerId`)
   - Order numbers should appear (resolved from `orderId`)
   - Pattern suggestions should appear if similar jobs exist

#### B. Quality Tracking with Compliance

1. **Navigate to Job Tasks** (`/jobs/[jobId]/tasks`)
2. **Complete a Task with Quality Assessment:**
   - Click "Complete with Quality Assessment" on any task
   - **Quality Dialog Should Appear** with:
     - Quality score slider (1-10)
     - Inspection type selection
     - Result classification
     - Dimensional measurements
     - AS9100D compliance indicators
     - Inspector notes and photo upload

3. **Verify Quality Integration:**
   - Quality scores should be recorded with relational context
   - Compliance requirements should be validated
   - Historical quality data should influence recommendations

#### C. Archive Intelligence with Relational Context

1. **Navigate to Archive Intelligence** (`/archive-intelligence`)
2. **Search for Historical Jobs:**
   - Search should return jobs with relational context
   - Related jobs should be grouped by customer/contract
   - Quality trends should show relational patterns

3. **Verify Archive Features:**
   - Historical data includes customer context
   - Quality scores are preserved with inspector information
   - Manufacturing forms show real setup times and notes
   - Traceability chains are maintained

#### D. Pattern Creation with Relational Insights

1. **Navigate to Jobs Page** (`/jobs`)
2. **Create Test Completed Jobs:**
   - Click "Create Test Completed Jobs" button
   - This creates 3 completed jobs for testing

3. **Create Pattern from Completed Job:**
   - Find a completed job (filter by "Completed" status)
   - Click the golden "Create Pattern" button
   - **Pattern Dialog Should Appear** with:
     - Pattern name and description
     - Source job relational context
     - Customer preferences (derived from relational data)
     - Process optimizations
     - Quality factors
     - Performance metrics

4. **Verify Pattern Features:**
   - Pattern includes customer relationship context
   - Quality requirements are inherited from customer contracts
   - Process recommendations use historical relational data

#### E. Manufacturing Calendar with Relational Events

1. **Navigate to Manufacturing Calendar** (`/planning/manufacturing-calendar`)
2. **Click on Calendar Events:**
   - Events should navigate directly to task details
   - Navigation should preserve relational context
   - Task interface should show archive intelligence

3. **Verify Calendar Integration:**
   - Events include job, machine, and operator relationships
   - Click-to-task navigation works
   - Context is preserved across navigation

### 3. Advanced Testing Scenarios

#### A. Complete Manufacturing Workflow

1. **Create Customer ‚Üí Order ‚Üí Job Chain:**
   ```
   Customer (with AS9100D requirements)
   ‚Üì
   Order (with contract clauses)
   ‚Üì
   Job (with quality plan)
   ‚Üì
   Tasks (with compliance tracking)
   ```

2. **Test Relationship Integrity:**
   - Customer changes should cascade to related orders/jobs
   - Quality requirements should flow through the chain
   - Compliance status should be maintained

#### B. Traceability Chain Validation

1. **Complete a Full Job with Quality Tracking**
2. **Verify Traceability Chain Includes:**
   - Material lot information
   - Machine and operator assignments
   - Quality checkpoints and measurements
   - Customer and contract relationships
   - AS9100D compliance records

#### C. Error Handling and Recovery

1. **Test Missing Relational Data:**
   - Create jobs with invalid customer IDs
   - Verify graceful degradation (shows "Unknown Customer")
   - System should continue functioning

2. **Test Broken Relationships:**
   - Delete referenced entities
   - Verify orphaned references are handled
   - Recovery mechanisms should activate

## üîç What to Look For
