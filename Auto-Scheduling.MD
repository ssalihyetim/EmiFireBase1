🔧 Algorithm Approaches - Comparison
1. Priority-Based Greedy Algorithm (RECOMMENDED START)
Concept: Simple, predictable, easy to debug and explain to users
Logic Flow:
Sort all process instances by priority (due date, customer priority, dependencies)
For each process instance:
Find all capable machines
Check availability and current workload
Assign to machine with earliest available slot
Update machine schedule
Pros:
Simple to implement and understand
Fast execution (<1 second for typical shop)
Easy to add manual overrides
Predictable results
Cons:
May not find globally optimal solution
Can create unnecessary delays if not carefully tuned
2. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
Concept: Model as mathematical optimization problem
Constraints:
Process dependencies (A before B)
Machine capabilities (only 5-axis machines can do complex geometry)
Time windows (working hours, maintenance)
Resource conflicts (one job per machine at a time)
Optimization Goals:
Minimize total makespan
Maximize machine utilization
Meet due dates
Pros:
Can find optimal or near-optimal solutions
Handles complex constraints elegantly
Can prove optimality
Cons:
Complex to implement
May be slow for large problems
Harder to explain to users
3. Genetic Algorithm / Metaheuristics
Concept: Evolutionary approach to find good solutions
Chromosome Representation:
Apply to PLANNING_ENH...
Gene = [MachineAssignment, StartTime]
Chromosome = [Gene1, Gene2, Gene3, ...] // One per process instance
Fitness Function:
Penalty for late deliveries
Reward for high machine utilization
Penalty for constraint violations
Pros:
Can handle very complex optimization
Good for large-scale problems
Can incorporate multiple objectives
Cons:
No guarantee of optimal solution
Tuning parameters is complex
Results may vary between runs
🎮 Recommended Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Smart Greedy Algorithm (Weeks 1-2)
Start with sophisticated priority-based scheduling:
Priority Calculation:
Apply to PLANNING_ENH...
ProcessPriority = {
  dueDate: weight1 * urgency,
  customerPriority: weight2 * vipStatus,
  dependencies: weight3 * criticalPath,
  setupOptimization: weight4 * setupSynergy,
  machinePreference: weight5 * machineMatch
}
Machine Selection Logic:
Capability Filter - Only machines that CAN do the job
Availability Check - When is each machine free?
Workload Balance - Prefer less loaded machines
Setup Optimization - Minimize changeover times
Operator Skills - Match operator capabilities
Phase 2: Dependency-Aware Scheduling (Week 3)
Critical Path Analysis:
Calculate longest dependency chain
Prioritize operations on critical path
Buffer non-critical operations
Dependency Resolution:
Apply to PLANNING_ENH...
SchedulingOrder = {
  1. Independent operations (no dependencies)
  2. Operations whose dependencies are scheduled
  3. Critical path operations first
  4. Break ties with due date priority
}
Phase 3: Local Optimization (Week 4)
Post-Schedule Improvements:
Swap operations between machines if beneficial
Slide operations earlier if possible
Group similar setups together
Minimize idle time
🔄 Real-Time Scheduling Challenges
Dynamic Rescheduling Triggers:
Machine Breakdown - Reassign all jobs from broken machine
Rush Orders - Insert high-priority jobs, push others back
Quality Issues - Rework adds time, affects downstream operations
Material Delays - Jobs can't start until material arrives
Operator Absence - Some machines require specific operators
Rescheduling Strategies:
Minimal Disruption - Only reschedule affected operations
Rolling Schedule - Reschedule everything from current time forward
Hybrid Approach - Protected vs. flexible time windows
🎯 Algorithm Components Breakdown
1. Machine Matcher
Apply to PLANNING_ENH...
findCapableMachines(processInstance) {
  // Filter by machine type
  // Check capabilities (threading, 5-axis, etc.)
  // Verify tooling availability
  // Consider operator requirements
}
2. Availability Calculator
Apply to PLANNING_ENH...
calculateAvailability(machine, timeWindow) {
  // Current job end times
  // Maintenance windows
  // Operator shifts
  // Setup/changeover buffers
  // Return: available time slots
}
3. Setup Time Optimizer
Apply to PLANNING_ENH...
calculateSetupTime(previousJob, newJob, machine) {
  // Same part family? Minimal setup
  // Different material? Longer changeover
  // Tool changes required?
  // Fixture changes?
}
4. Dependency Resolver
Apply to PLANNING_ENH...
resolveDependencies(processInstances) {
  // Build dependency graph
  // Topological sort
  // Calculate critical path
  // Identify parallel opportunities
}
5. Schedule Validator
Apply to PLANNING_ENH...
validateSchedule(schedule) {
  // All dependencies satisfied?
  // No machine conflicts?
  // Within working hours?
  // Operator availability?
  // Due dates achievable?
}

# 🧠 Auto-Scheduling Algorithm - Planning & Brainstorming

## 🎯 Core Challenge
Transform the enhanced planning system (with multiple process instances and manual ordering) into an intelligent scheduler that automatically assigns operations to specific machines with optimal timing.

---

## 🔍 **CODEBASE ANALYSIS & POTENTIAL CONFLICTS**

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues Identified**

#### **1. Data Structure Misalignment**
**Current vs. Proposed Schema Conflicts:**

**Current `ProcessInstance` (Enhanced Planning):**
```typescript
interface ProcessInstance {
  id: string;
  baseProcessName: string;
  instanceNumber: number;
  displayName: string;
  machineType: MachineType;
  setupTimeMinutes: number;
  cycleTimeMinutes: number;
  orderIndex: number;
  estimatedCost: number;
  dependencies: string[]; // Process instance IDs
}
```

**Proposed Auto-Scheduling Input:**
```typescript
ProcessInstance[] = [
  {
    id: "turning-1-abc123",
    quantity: 100, // ❌ MISSING from current implementation
    dependencies: [] // ✅ EXISTS but different usage
  }
]
```

**🚨 CONFLICT:** Current `ProcessInstance` lacks `quantity` field, but auto-scheduling algorithms need this for time calculations.

#### **2. Missing Critical Database Collections**
**Current Collections (from codebase):**
- ✅ `machines` - EXISTS
- ✅ `offers` - EXISTS  
- ✅ `orders` - EXISTS
- ❌ `schedules` - MISSING
- ❌ `schedule_runs` - MISSING
- ❌ `operator_logs` - MISSING
- ❌ `workload_summaries` - MISSING

**🚨 PROBLEM:** Auto-scheduling requires schedule persistence, but no schedule storage exists.

#### **3. Machine Data Gaps**
**Current Machine Interface:**
```typescript
interface Machine {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: MachineType;
  capabilities?: string[];
  hourlyRate?: number;
  // ❌ MISSING: currentJobs, availableFrom, maintenanceWindows, operatorRequired
}
```

**Auto-Scheduling Needs:**
```typescript
interface Machine {
  currentJobs: [...], // ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
  availableFrom: "2024-01-15 08:00", // ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
  maintenanceWindows: [...], // ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
  operatorRequired: "turning_certified" // ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
}
```

**🚨 IMPACT:** Cannot calculate machine availability without this data.

---

### 🔧 **Implementation Conflicts**

#### **4. Type System Inconsistencies**

**Current OfferItem Planning Data:**
```typescript
// From src/types/index.ts
planningData?: {
  processes: Array<{
    id: string;
    name: string;
    machineType: 'turning' | 'milling' | '5-axis';
    setupTimeMinutes: number;
    cycleTimeMinutes: number;
    orderIndex: number;
    estimatedCost: number;
    dependencies?: string[]; // ❌ Optional, but auto-scheduling needs required
  }>;
}
```

**Auto-Scheduling Requirement:**
```typescript
dependencies: string[]; // ❌ Must be required, not optional
```

**🚨 CONFLICT:** Optional dependencies break dependency resolution algorithms.

#### **5. Missing Time Management System**

**Current Implementation:** No working hours, shifts, or time window management
**Auto-Scheduling Needs:**
- Working hours per day (8:00-17:00)
- Shift patterns
- Break times
- Maintenance windows
- Operator availability

**🚨 BLOCKER:** Cannot schedule without time constraints definition.

---

### 📊 **Database Schema Conflicts**

#### **6. Firebase Collection Naming Inconsistency**
**Current Pattern:**
```typescript
const MACHINES_COLLECTION = "machines"; // ✅ Good
const OFFERS_COLLECTION_NAME = "offers"; // ✅ Good
const ORDERS_COLLECTION_NAME = "orders"; // ✅ Good
```

**Proposed Auto-Scheduling Collections:**
```typescript
// ❌ UNDEFINED: Where do these go?
schedules/{machineId}/jobs/{jobId}
scheduling_runs/{runId}
```

**🚨 ISSUE:** Inconsistent subcollection strategy needs definition.

#### **7. Timestamp Handling Inconsistency**
**Current Pattern (from types):**
```typescript
// Firebase version
scheduledStartTime: Timestamp;
// Client version  
scheduledStartTime: string;
```

**Auto-Scheduling Proposal:**
```typescript
startTime: timestamp, // ❌ UNDEFINED format
availableFrom: "2024-01-15 08:00", // ❌ String format inconsistent
```

**🚨 PROBLEM:** Mixed timestamp formats will cause conversion errors.

---

### 🎮 **Component Integration Issues**

#### **8. Enhanced Planning Section Isolation**
**Current:** `EnhancedPlanningSection` creates `ProcessInstance[]` but they're not persisted to database
**Auto-Scheduling Needs:** Access to all process instances across all offers/orders

**🚨 GAP:** No bridge between planning UI and scheduling backend.

#### **9. Missing API Layer**
**Current:** Direct Firebase calls in components
**Auto-Scheduling Needs:**
```typescript
POST /api/scheduling/auto-schedule
GET  /api/scheduling/machines/{machineId}/schedule  
```

**🚨 MISSING:** No API routes exist for scheduling operations.

#### **10. Real-time Updates Architecture**
**Current:** Static data loading with manual refresh
**Auto-Scheduling Needs:** Real-time schedule updates, operator logging

**🚨 ARCHITECTURE GAP:** No real-time infrastructure in place.

---

### 🔍 **Undefined Terms & Missing Definitions**

#### **11. Process Capability Mapping**
**Used in Auto-Scheduling:**
```typescript
requiredMachineCapabilities: ["5-axis-milling", "complex-geometry"]
```

**Current Capability Values (from machines page):**
```typescript
capabilities: ["turning", "threading", "grooving"] // ✅ Defined
capabilities: ["3-axis-milling", "drilling", "tapping"] // ✅ Defined  
capabilities: ["5-axis-milling", "complex-geometry"] // ✅ Defined
```

**✅ STATUS:** Actually well-defined, no conflict here.

#### **12. Priority System**
**Auto-Scheduling Assumes:**
```typescript
ProcessPriority = {
  dueDate: weight1 * urgency,
  customerPriority: weight2 * vipStatus, // ❌ vipStatus UNDEFINED
  dependencies: weight3 * criticalPath,
  setupOptimization: weight4 * setupSynergy, // ❌ setupSynergy UNDEFINED
}
```

**Current Offer/Order:** No priority or urgency fields
**🚨 MISSING:** Priority system needs full definition.

---

### 💾 **Data Migration Requirements**

#### **13. Existing Offers Enhancement**
**Current Offers:** Already have `planningData` but missing:
- ❌ `quantity` in process instances (it's in OfferItem level)
- ❌ `dueDate` consistently  
- ❌ `customerPriority`

**Migration Needed:** Update existing offers to include missing fields.

#### **14. Machine Data Enhancement**
**Current Machines:** Need additional fields:
```typescript
// Missing fields to add:
currentWorkload: ScheduleEntry[];
availabilityCalendar: TimeSlot[];
operatorRequirements: string[];
maintenanceSchedule: MaintenanceWindow[];
```

---

```typescript
// 1. Enhance ProcessInstance interface
interface ProcessInstance {
  // ... existing fields ...
  quantity: number; // ✅ ADD THIS
  dueDate?: string; // ✅ ADD THIS  
  customerPriority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'vip'; // ✅ ADD THIS
}

// 2. Create Schedule collection schema
interface ScheduleEntry {
  id: string;
  machineId: string;
  processInstanceId: string;
  orderId: string;
  startTime: Timestamp; // ✅ Use Firebase Timestamp consistently
  endTime: Timestamp;
  status: 'scheduled' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
}
```

#### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 2)**
