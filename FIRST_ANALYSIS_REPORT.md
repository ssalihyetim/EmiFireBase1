## Detailed Analysis

### ERR-001: `asChild` Prop on DOM Element
**Problem**: React doesn't recognize the `asChild` prop on DOM elements. This occurs when using Radix UI or similar libraries with composition patterns.

**Location**: 
- `src/components/layout/sidebar-nav.tsx:154`
- `src/components/layout/sidebar-nav.tsx:136`

**Root Cause**: The `Link` component is passing `asChild` prop to its child component, but the child component isn't properly handling it using Radix's `Slot` pattern.

**Solution Strategy**:
1. Filter out `asChild` prop in the target components
2. Ensure proper `Slot` usage for composition pattern
3. Update both `SidebarMenuButton` and `SidebarMenuSubButton` components

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

**Technical Details**: Browser extensions like Grammarly inject attributes like `data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded` and `data-gr-ext-installed` into the body element after React hydrates, causing a mismatch between server and client HTML. The `suppressHydrationWarning` prop tells React to ignore these differences.

### ERR-001 & ERR-003: `asChild` Prop and Nested Anchor Tags ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation Date**: Current session
**Changes Made**:
1. Fixed `SidebarMenuSubButton` component to default to `button` element instead of `a` element
2. Updated TypeScript types from `HTMLAnchorElement` to `HTMLButtonElement`
3. Maintained proper `Slot` pattern for composition when `asChild` is true
4. Ensured `asChild` prop filtering is working correctly in both components

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` - Updated `SidebarMenuSubButton` component

**Technical Details**: The root cause was that `SidebarMenuSubButton` defaulted to an anchor element (`<a>`), which created nested anchor tags when used with Next.js `Link` components that have `asChild={true}`. By changing the default element to `button`, we eliminate the nested anchor issue while maintaining proper composition patterns through Radix UI's `Slot` component. The `SidebarMenuButton` was already handling this correctly.

**Resolution**: Both ERR-001 and ERR-003 were resolved with this single change since they were manifestations of the same underlying issue - improper handling of the composition pattern in the sidebar navigation components.

### ERR-005: `asChild` Prop Still Passed to next-intl Link ✅ COMPLETED  
**Implementation Date**: Current session
**Changes Made**:
1. Removed all `asChild` usage from `next-intl` Link components
2. Replaced Link+asChild pattern with programmatic navigation using `useRouter().push()`
3. Added onClick handlers to SidebarMenuButton and SidebarMenuSubButton components
4. Added proper TypeScript type assertion for navigation paths

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/layout/sidebar-nav.tsx` - Replaced Link+asChild with router.push navigation

**Technical Details**: The `next-intl` Link component doesn't support the `asChild` prop that Radix UI components use for composition. Instead of trying to make them work together, we switched to programmatic navigation which is cleaner and avoids the DOM prop issues entirely. This maintains the same user experience while eliminating the React warnings.

### ERR-002: Hydration mismatch
**Problem**: Server-rendered HTML doesn't match client HTML, likely due to browser extensions adding attributes to the body element.

**Location**: `src/app/layout.tsx:26`

**Root Cause**: Browser extensions (like Grammarly) are injecting attributes into the body element, causing hydration mismatches.

**Solution Strategy**:
1. Add `suppressHydrationWarning` to the body element
2. Move font loading and other dynamic attributes to client-side only
3. Consider using `useEffect` for extension-injected attributes

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

**Verification**: The code `t('na', {defaultMessage:'N/A'})` in `src/app/[locale]/jobs/page.tsx:186-187` will now properly resolve to the translated text.

### ERR-002: Hydration Mismatch ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation Date**: Current session
**Changes Made**:
1. Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the `<body>` element in root layout
2. This prevents React from warning about hydration mismatches caused by browser extensions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to body element

**Technical Details**: Browser extensions like Grammarly inject attributes like `data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded` and `data-gr-ext-installed` into the body element after React hydrates, causing a mismatch between server and client HTML. The `suppressHydrationWarning` prop tells React to ignore these differences.

---

### ERR-003: Nested Anchor Tags
**Problem**: HTML doesn't allow `<a>` elements to be nested inside other `<a>` elements, causing hydration errors.

**Location**: Multiple locations in sidebar navigation

**Root Cause**: `Link` components with `asChild` are creating nested anchor tags when used with `SidebarMenuButton` and `SidebarMenuSubButton` components.

**Solution Strategy**:
1. Remove default anchor element from `SidebarMenuSubButton`
2. Use proper `Slot` pattern for composition
3. Ensure `asChild` prop is correctly handled

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

### ERR-004: Missing Translation Key
**Problem**: Translation key `JobsPage.na` is missing in the English locale file.

**Location**: `src/app/[locale]/jobs/page.tsx:186-187`

**Root Cause**: Code is trying to use `t('na')` but the key doesn't exist in the `JobsPage` namespace.

**Solution Strategy**:
1. Add `na` key to `JobsPage` in `messages/en.json`
2. Add corresponding translation in `messages/tr.json`
3. Alternative: Use `Common.na` instead

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Fix `asChild` prop handling in sidebar components
2. ✅ Resolve nested anchor tag issues

### Phase 2: Hydration Issues (Medium Priority) ✅ COMPLETED
3. ✅ Add proper hydration warning suppression

### Phase 3: Translation Fixes (Low Priority) ✅ COMPLETED
4. ✅ Add missing translation keys

## Notes
- All issues are related to component composition patterns and Next.js SSR
- Priority should be given to HTML validity issues (nested anchors)
- Hydration issues may be partially mitigated by browser extension behavior

## Implementation Details

### ERR-004: Missing Translation Key ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation Date**: Current session
**Changes Made**:
1. Added `"na": "N/A"` to `JobsPage` section in `messages/en.json`
2. Added `"na": "B/A"` to `JobsPage` section in `messages/tr.json` (Turkish translation)
3. Translation now properly resolves for both locales

**Files Modified**:
- `messages/en.json` - Added `na` key to JobsPage section
- `messages/tr.json` - Added `na` key to JobsPage section

**Verification**: The code `t('na', {defaultMessage:'N/A'})` in `src/app/[locale]/jobs/page.tsx:186-187` will now properly resolve to the translated text.
