### 4. Task Automation Page Updates
- Updated information cards to reflect **5 standard subtasks** for manufacturing processes
- Added visual indicators for new features:
  - Material Approval shows "+Traceability" badge
  - Lot Based Production Planning shows "4 Subtasks" badge
  - FAI now listed as 5th standard subtask
- Updated AS9100D compliance section to highlight "FAI & Traceability"
- Added Calendar icon for Lot Based Production Planning
- Updated subtask icons and colors to support FAI (red color scheme)

## üìä Task Generation Summary

### For Each Job, Now Generates:
- **Non-Manufacturing Tasks**: 5 tasks
  1. Contract Review (2 subtasks)
  2. Material Approval (3 subtasks) ‚Üê **Updated**
  3. Lot Based Production Planning (4 subtasks) ‚Üê **New**
  4. Final Inspection (2 subtasks)
  5. Packaging (2 subtasks)

- **Manufacturing Tasks**: Variable based on assigned processes
  - Each process now has **5 subtasks** (was 4) ‚Üê **Updated**
  - Subtasks: Setup Sheet, Tool List, Tool Life Verification, Machining, **FAI** ‚Üê **New**

### Example for Sample Order (Turning + 3-Axis + 5-Axis):
- **Total Tasks**: 8 (5 non-manufacturing + 3 manufacturing)
- **Total Subtasks**: 29 (13 non-manufacturing + 15 manufacturing + 1 new FAI per process)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **src/types/tasks.ts**
   - Added `'fai'` to ManufacturingSubtaskType
   - Added `'lot_based_production_planning'` to NonManufacturingTaskType

2. **src/config/subtask-templates.ts**
   - Added `set_traceability_lot_number` subtask
   - Added 4 new lot-based production planning subtasks
   - Added 3 FAI subtask variants
   - Updated `getStandardManufacturingSubtasks()` to include FAI (5 subtasks)
   - Updated `getNonManufacturingTaskSubtasks()` for new task types

3. **src/config/task-templates.ts**
   - Added `lot_based_production_planning` task template
   - Added to `COMPULSORY_TASK_IDS` array

4. **src/app/[locale]/task-automation/page.tsx**
   - Updated UI to reflect 5 manufacturing subtasks
   - Added new task information and badges
   - Updated subtask icons and colors for FAI
   - Enhanced information cards

5. **src/components/task-automation/task-editor.tsx**

## ‚úÖ Features Working
- ‚úÖ Material Approval includes traceability subtask
- ‚úÖ Lot Based Production Planning task with 4 subtasks
- ‚úÖ FAI subtask added to all manufacturing processes
- ‚úÖ Updated task automation page shows new features
- ‚úÖ All task generation functions updated
