# Manufacturing Calendar System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive manufacturing calendar system to replace the old production scheduling approach. All existing scheduled operations have been removed and replaced with a modern calendar-based system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Cleanup ✅
- **Script**: `scripts/cleanup-scheduled-operations.ts`
- **Collections Cleaned**:
  - `scheduleEntries`
  - `productionSchedule`
  - `machineSchedule`
  - `operationSchedule`
- **Additional Cleanup**: Removed scheduling fields from job tasks
- **Safety**: Requires confirmation with `CONFIRM_CLEANUP_SCHEDULE=YES_DELETE_ALL_SCHEDULED_OPERATIONS`

### 2. Manufacturing Calendar Types ✅
- **File**: `src/types/manufacturing-calendar.ts`
- **Key Types**:
  - `CalendarEvent` - Core event structure
  - `CalendarEventType` - Manufacturing, maintenance, setup, etc.
  - `DayView` & `WeekView` - Calendar display structures
  - `CalendarFilter` - Advanced filtering options
  - `CalendarSettings` - User preferences and configuration
  - `MachineCalendarData` - Machine-specific calendar data

### 3. Calendar Service Library ✅
- **File**: `src/lib/manufacturing-calendar.ts`
- **Functions**:
  - `createCalendarEvent()` - Create new events
  - `updateCalendarEvent()` - Update existing events
  - `deleteCalendarEvent()` - Remove events
  - `getDayView()` - Get day-specific calendar data
  - `getWeekView()` - Get week-specific calendar data
  - Conflict detection and validation
  - Machine utilization calculations

### 4. Manufacturing Calendar Page ✅
- **File**: `src/app/[locale]/planning/manufacturing-calendar/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - **Dual View Support**: Day and Week views
  - **Statistics Dashboard**: 6 key metrics cards
  - **Navigation Controls**: Previous/Next/Today buttons
  - **Event Management**: Create, edit, delete events
  - **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh capability
  - **Filter System**: Advanced filtering by machines, operators, priorities
  - **Settings Management**: Customizable preferences

### 5. Supporting Components ✅
- **Stats Card**: `src/components/manufacturing-calendar/StatsCard.tsx`
- **Default Settings**: Exported from types with sensible defaults
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## URL Access
- **Main Calendar**: `/en/planning/manufacturing-calendar`
- **Navigation**: Accessible via Planning menu in sidebar

## Statistics Tracked
1. **Total Events** - All scheduled items
2. **Manufacturing Events** - Production operations
3. **Maintenance Events** - Equipment maintenance
4. **Average Utilization** - Machine efficiency
5. **Completed Events** - Finished tasks
6. **Delayed Events** - Overdue items

## Event Types Supported
- `manufacturing` - Production operations
- `maintenance` - Equipment servicing
- `setup` - Machine preparation
- `quality_check` - Inspection activities
- `meeting` - Team meetings
- `training` - Staff development
- `break` - Scheduled downtime
- `other` - Miscellaneous events

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
- Events stored in `calendarEvents` collection
- Machine data linked via `machineId` references
- Job integration through `jobId` and `taskId` fields
- Firestore timestamps for all date/time fields

### Real-time Features
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds (configurable)
- Immediate UI updates after changes
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states during data operations

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient date range queries
- Cached machine data
- Optimistic UI updates
- Parallel data loading

## Next Steps for Enhancement
1. **Drag & Drop**: Enable event rescheduling via drag-and-drop
2. **Advanced Views**: Month and timeline views
3. **Reporting**: Export capabilities and analytics
4. **Integration**: Connect with existing job workflow
5. **Notifications**: Email/SMS alerts for important events
6. **Mobile App**: Native mobile calendar interface

## Migration Notes
- All old scheduling data has been safely removed
- No impact on existing job creation workflow
- Manufacturing forms (Routing Sheet, Setup Sheet, Tool List) remain unchanged
- Calendar is completely independent system ready for gradual adoption

## Dependencies
- Firebase/Firestore for data storage
- Next.js with TypeScript
- React hooks for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide icons for UI elements

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL
The manufacturing calendar system is fully functional and ready for use. Users can now schedule and track manufacturing operations, maintenance activities, and other production-related events through an intuitive calendar interface.
