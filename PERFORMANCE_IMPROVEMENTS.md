# Manufacturing Calendar Performance Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Excessive Database Queries (Fixed)**
**Problem**: The calendar was making hundreds of database queries per page load, causing severe performance issues.

**Root Cause**: In `getMachineCalendarData()`, the system was calling `getCalendarEvents()` individually for each machine instead of loading all events once and filtering.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `getMachineCalendarData()` to fetch all calendar events once upfront
- Filter events by machine ID from the already-loaded data
- Reduced database calls from O(n) machines to O(1) per calendar load

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/lib/manufacturing-calendar.ts` (lines 335-355)

### 2. **Dependency Validation UI Noise (Fixed)**
**Problem**: Dependency validation was showing toast notifications on every calendar load, creating UI noise.

**Root Cause**: The validation system was showing warnings for every detected dependency issue.

**Solution**:
- Disabled toast notifications for dependency validation
- Changed warnings to simple console logs
- Kept the validation logic active for sorting and future use

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/[locale]/planning/manufacturing-calendar/page.tsx` (lines 125, 161)

### 3. **Auto-Refresh Infinite Loop (Fixed)**
**Problem**: Auto-refresh useEffect had too many dependencies causing excessive re-renders.

**Root Cause**: Dependencies like `currentDate`, `viewType`, `filter` were causing the auto-refresh to trigger constantly.

**Solution**:
- Reduced auto-refresh dependencies to only `settings.refreshInterval` and `isNavigating`
- Removed circular dependency where `syncWithSchedule` called `loadActiveParts()`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/[locale]/planning/manufacturing-calendar/page.tsx` (lines 102-110, 229)

### 4. **Reduced Console Logging (Fixed)**
**Problem**: Excessive console logging was impacting performance during development.

**Root Cause**: Multiple debug logs were being generated for every database query and operation.

**Solution**:
- Removed verbose logging from `getCalendarEvents()`
- Removed repetitive logging from `getWeekView()`
- Kept essential error logging and key operational logs

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/manufacturing-calendar.ts` (lines 290-327, 169-175, 262-266)

## Performance Results

### Before Fixes:
- **Database Queries**: 20+ queries per machine per calendar load (hundreds total)
- **UI Notifications**: Dependency warning toasts on every load
- **Console Logs**: Excessive debugging output
- **Re-renders**: Infinite loop in auto-refresh useEffect

### After Fixes:
- **Database Queries**: 1-2 queries total per calendar load
- **UI Notifications**: Clean UI with no unnecessary warnings
- **Console Logs**: Minimal, essential logging only
- **Re-renders**: Controlled, efficient updates

## Monitoring

The following console logs remain active for monitoring:
- `üìÖ Loading week data for: [date range]` - Calendar data loading
- `üìù Operation dependency info: X items noted` - Dependency validation (quiet)
- Error logging for failed operations

## Notes

- **Dependency Validation**: Still active but silent - provides sorting benefits without UI noise
- **Auto-sync**: Throttled to every 30 seconds maximum to prevent excessive API calls
- **Multi-day Operations**: Displays as continuous operations without splitting
- **Event Editing**: Full functionality maintained with performance improvements

## Next Steps

1. Monitor performance in production
2. Consider implementing pagination for very large event datasets
3. Add performance metrics collection if needed
