## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### Issue #1: Manufacturing Calendar
**Root Cause**: Duplicate manufacturing calendar pages existed:
- **Old/Placeholder**: `/src/app/[locale]/manufacturing-calendar/page.tsx` ‚Üê Was being served
- **New/Functional**: `/src/app/[locale]/planning/manufacturing-calendar/page.tsx` ‚Üê Correct implementation

**Navigation Issue**: `src/config/nav.ts` was pointing to `/manufacturing-calendar` instead of `/planning/manufacturing-calendar`

### Issue #2: 26 Scheduled Operations  
**Root Cause**: Firebase `schedules` collection contained 26 documents that weren't being cleaned by CLI scripts due to Firebase authentication/connection issues in server environment.

**API Issue**: The production schedule API was successfully querying Firebase and returning the 26 operations, but cleanup scripts failed to connect properly.

## ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented**

### Solution #1: Manufacturing Calendar Fix
1. **Deleted** old placeholder page: `src/app/[locale]/manufacturing-calendar/page.tsx`
2. **Fixed** navigation link in `src/config/nav.ts`:
   ```typescript
   href: "/planning/manufacturing-calendar"  // ‚Üê Corrected path
   ```
3. **Result**: Manufacturing calendar now loads properly with full functionality

### Solution #2: Schedule Operations Cleanup
1. **Created** API-based cleanup endpoint: `/api/cleanup-schedules`
2. **Executed** cleanup via HTTP call instead of CLI script
3. **Deleted** all 26 documents from `schedules` collection
4. **Result**: Production schedule now shows 0 operations

## üß™ **Verification Results**

### Manufacturing Calendar ‚úÖ **WORKING**
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:9004/en/planning/manufacturing-calendar"
```
**Result**: Properly renders React components with:
- Manufacturing Calendar header
- Stats cards (Total Events: 0, Manufacturing: 0, etc.)
- Day/Week view tabs
- Calendar navigation controls
- Working interface (no more placeholder text)

```
**Result**: 
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "entries": [],
  "machineCount": 30,
  "totalEntries": 0
}
```

### Schedule Collections ‚úÖ **EMPTY**
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:9004/api/cleanup-schedules"
```
**Result**:
```json
