## 🔥 What Was Removed

### Deprecated App Routes (14 files)
All non-locale routes that were replaced by `[locale]` versions:
- `src/app/page.tsx` → `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/jobs/page.tsx` → `src/app/[locale]/jobs/page.tsx`
- `src/app/offers/**` → `src/app/[locale]/offers/**`
- `src/app/orders/**` → `src/app/[locale]/orders/**`
- `src/app/records/**` → `src/app/[locale]/records/**`
- `src/app/quality-manual/page.tsx` → `src/app/[locale]/quality-manual/page.tsx`
- `src/app/balance/page.tsx` → `src/app/[locale]/balance/page.tsx`
- `src/app/templates/page.tsx` → Integrated into records

### Temporary Files (2 files)
- `temp_check.json`
- `temp_archives.json`

### Legacy Scripts (4 files)
- `scripts/seed-machines.js` → superseded by `.ts` version
- `scripts/seed-machines-basic.js`
- `scripts/seed-machines-simple.js`
- `scripts/test-automation.js` → superseded by `.ts` versions

### Debug Scripts (8 files)
- `scripts/debug-archive-data.ts`
- `scripts/debug-archive-search.ts`
- `scripts/debug-scheduled-operations.ts`
- Plus 5 other troubleshooting scripts

### One-time Scripts (5 files)
- `scripts/create-test-archived-jobs.ts`
